# 🤖 Navigentha — Agentic AI Career Execution Engine

Navigentha is an **Agentic AI system** built to transform career decisions into **structured execution systems**.

While Career Advisor helps users discover *what* they should do,  
Navigentha focuses on **how they actually do it**.

---

## 🧠 Vision

> Every career decision must become a system.

Navigentha turns ambition into action.

---

## 🚧 Problem

Most career platforms stop after giving advice:
- “Learn this skill”
- “Follow this career”
- “Try this roadmap”

But no one tells users:
- how to execute,
- how to track progress,
- how to adapt when they fail,
- how to keep going.

---

## 💡 Solution

Navigentha is an **autonomous career execution engine** that:
- asks the right questions,
- makes decisions,
- builds roadmaps,
- tracks progress,
- adapts continuously.
